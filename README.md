Assignment 5.
Select 1 or 2 for integer or file reading.
The integer selected will be the number of rows and columns for the square matrix. It create 2 separate ones, and write them to a file. Then, it will perform matrix multiplication and write the result to a file.
If you enter 2 file names that exist, it will read the matrices in these files. It will perform matrix multiplication and write the result to a file.
It's recommended to do option 1 first, so that there will be 2 files (with matrices in them) that you can read for the 2nd option.
